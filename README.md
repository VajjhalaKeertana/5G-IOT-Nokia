# 5G-IOT-Nokia
To devise a smart agricultural monitoring system that can collect crucial relevant data, directing it to an IoT platform- Thingspeak in real-time where it can be logged and analyzed. The logged data on Thingspeak is in a graphical format so that a botanist or a reasonably knowledgeable farmer can analyze the data to make sensible changes in the supplied resources producing a high-quality yield.
Have attached the report of the project which contains the introduction, components and the ArduinoC code.
